# LoomDev v0.1 - Setup Summary

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Repository**: https://github.com/Legend1280/loomdev  
**Status**: Initial Setup Complete ✅

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Repository Creation

The LoomDev repository has been successfully created by duplicating the LoomLite v4.0 codebase. This provides a solid foundation with the proven four-panel architecture that LoomDev will extend with developer-centric features.

**Repository Details:**
- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/Legend1280/loomdev
- **Base**: LoomLite v4.0 (Legend1280/loomlite)
- **Branch**: main
- **Commits**: 2 initial commits

### 2. Branding Updates

The project has been rebranded from LoomLite to LoomDev across key files:

**Updated Files:**
- `README.md` - Complete rewrite with LoomDev vision and roadmap
- `frontend/index.html` - Updated title and HTML comment
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Created to track development progress
- `LOOMDEV_CONCEPT.md` - Added conceptual developer handoff documentation
- `ONTOLOGY_STANDARD_v1.4.md` - Added ontology standards reference

**Preserved Files:**
- `README_LOOMLITE_BACKUP.md` - Original LoomLite README preserved for reference

### 3. Architecture Preservation

LoomDev inherits the complete LoomLite architecture:

**Frontend Modules (JavaScript):**
- `eventBus.js` - Central pub/sub communication system
- `galaxyView.js` - Multi-document cluster visualization (to be made editable)
- `dualVisualizer.js` - Solar system view for intra-document concepts
- `mindMapView.js` - Hierarchical mind map visualization
- `surfaceViewer.js` - Metadata and artifact interface
- `sidebar.js` - File system and navigation sidebar
- `quadrantFocus.js` - Dynamic panel expansion
- `searchBar.js` - Semantic search functionality
- `systemStatus.js` - System status monitoring

**Backend Modules (Python):**
- `main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `api.py` - API endpoint definitions
- `models.py` - Data models
- `extractor.py` - Concept extraction logic
- `semantic_cluster.py` - Clustering algorithms
- `file_system.py` - File management
- `analytics.py` - Analytics and metrics

**Configuration Files:**
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `railway.json` - Railway backend deployment configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### 4. Documentation Added

Comprehensive documentation has been added to guide LoomDev development:

**Core Documentation:**
- **README.md** - Project overview, architecture, features, and roadmap
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and planned features
- **LOOMDEV_CONCEPT.md** - Full conceptual developer handoff (from pasted_content.txt)
- **ONTOLOGY_STANDARD_v1.4.md** - Ontology design standards

**Inherited Documentation:**
- All LoomLite v4.0 documentation preserved for reference
- Developer handoff documents
- System diagrams
- Quick reference guides

## Current State

### What Works (Inherited from LoomLite)

LoomDev currently has all the functionality of LoomLite v4.0:

1. **Document Visualization** - View document ontologies in Galaxy, Solar System, and Mind Map views
2. **Semantic Search** - Search across documents with concept filtering
3. **Interactive Navigation** - Click, drag, zoom, and explore visualizations
4. **Quadrant Focus** - Double-click panels to expand, triple-click to center
5. **File Management** - Sidebar with hierarchical document organization
6. **Surface Viewer** - View ontology metadata, document content, and analytics
7. **Backend API** - FastAPI server with document ingestion and extraction

### What Needs to Be Built (LoomDev v0.1 Features)

The following features are planned for LoomDev v0.1 to transform it from a viewer into an authoring tool:

1. **Developer Mode Toggle**
   - Toolbar button to switch between View and Edit modes
   - Event bus integration for mode changes
   - UI state management

2. **Editable Galaxy View**
   - Click to create new ontology objects (nodes)
   - Drag to draw connections between objects
   - Label edges with relationship types and I/O metadata
   - Delete nodes and edges
   - Edit node properties

3. **Manual JSON Object Upload**
   - Upload button for JSON ontology objects
   - Schema validation
   - Immediate visualization in Galaxy View
   - Backend storage

4. **Artifact Linking System**
   - Attach PDFs, patents, specifications to nodes
   - View artifacts in Surface Viewer
   - Multiple artifacts per object
   - Backend file storage

5. **Ontology Export**
   - Export to JSON format
   - Export to GraphML for graph databases
   - Export to Mermaid for documentation
   - Export to C4 for architecture diagrams

6. **Extended Event Bus**
   - New events: `objectCreated`, `objectLinked`, `schemaImported`, `artifactLinked`, `modeChanged`
   - Event handlers for developer mode operations

7. **Backend API Extensions**
   - `POST /api/ontology/object` - Create/update objects
   - `POST /api/ontology/relation` - Create relations
   - `POST /api/schema/import` - Upload schemas
   - `POST /api/artifact/upload` - Attach artifacts
   - `GET /api/system/export` - Export ontology

## Key Concepts

### Four-Panel Architecture

LoomDev inherits LoomLite's proven four-panel layout:

1. **Sidebar (Left)** - File management, search, schemas, status
2. **Center Panel** - Visualization canvas (Galaxy/Solar/Mind Map)
3. **Surface Viewer (Right)** - Metadata, artifacts, analytics
4. **Event Bus (Hidden)** - Communication backbone

### Developer Mode vs. Viewer Mode

**Viewer Mode (Inherited from LoomLite):**
- Read-only visualization
- Document ingestion and extraction
- Search and navigation
- Analytics and insights

**Developer Mode (New in LoomDev):**
- Editable visualizations
- Manual object creation
- Connection drawing
- Artifact linking
- Ontology export

### Event-Driven Architecture

All components communicate through the event bus:
- Loose coupling between modules
- Easy to extend with new features
- Consistent state management
- Supports undo/redo (future)

5. ⏳ Artifacts can be attached to nodes
6. ⏳ Ontologies can be exported to JSON and GraphML
7. ⏳ Application is deployed to Vercel
8. ⏳ Backend is deployed to Railway
9. ⏳ All inherited LoomLite features still work
